Feature: Tabs can be used in topics2 format
  In order to rearrange my course contents
  As a teacher
  I need to move topics into tabs and back

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email            |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format | coursedisplay | numsections |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics2 | 0             | 5           |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity   | name                   | intro                         | course | idnumber    | section |
      | assign     | Test assignment name   | Test assignment description   | C1     | assign1     | 0       |
      | book       | Test book name         | Test book description         | C1     | book1       | 1       |

      | choice     | Test choice name       | Test choice description       | C1     | choice1     | 5       |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on

  Scenario: Deleting the last section in topics2 format
    When I delete section "5"
    Then I should see "Are you absolutely sure you want to completely delete \"Topic 5\" and all the activities it contains?"
    And I press "Delete"
    And I should not see "Topic 5"
    And I should see "Topic 4"
