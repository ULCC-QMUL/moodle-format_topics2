Feature: Tabs can be used in topics2 format
  In order to rearrange my course contents
  As a teacher

    And the following "activities" exist:

    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on

  Scenario: View the default name of the general section in topics2 format
    When I edit the section "0"
    Then the field "Custom" matches value "0"
    And the field "New value for Section name" matches value "General"
    And I click on "Custom" "Link"
    Then the field "Custom" matches value "1"
